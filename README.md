This repo contains the code for the QHack challenge "Bridging the gap".

The challenge was about calculating the *spectral gap*. The spectral gap of a system is the energy difference between its ground state and its first excited state.
There are many situations in which knowing this value is very important and the objective was be to design and implement a method that is able to obtain this quantity.
